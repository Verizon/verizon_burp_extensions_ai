## Decision Making Process

Maintainers follow these principles when making decisions:

- **Consensus-seeking**: We strive for consensus among maintainers for significant decisions
- **Transparency**: Major decisions are discussed openly in issues or pull requests
- **Technical merit**: Decisions are based on technical merit rather than personal preference
- **Project alignment**: Changes should align with the project's goals and roadmap

For disagreements that cannot be resolved through discussion, a majority vote among maintainers may be used.
